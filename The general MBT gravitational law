The general MBT gravitational law is expressed as:

a(r,t) = Σ [ v_j² / r_ij * exp(-λ r_ij) * r̂_ij ]

- a = acceleration experienced by body i
- v_j = velocity of body j (relative motion drives curvature)
- r_ij = distance between i and j
- λ = damping constant (sets precession, prevents collapse)
- r̂_ij = unit vector pointing from i to j

For a single body in orbit, MBT defines precession through a pure velocity-radius relation:
α = v² / (r * c)

Here, α defines orbital precession without mass or G, using only velocity (v), orbital radius (r), and the speed of light (c) as the curvature scale.

Orbital stability arises from the geometry of motion, not angular momentum with mass:
r · v = constant
